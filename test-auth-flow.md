# Authentication Flow Test

## Issue Fixed: Users could login without signing up

### Problem
- Users could access the dashboard by simply signing in with Google OAuth
- No distinction between sign up and sign in
- Automatic user profile creation on any OAuth login

### Solution Implemented

1. **Modified OAuth Callback Route** (`app/auth/callback/route.ts`)
   - Added `registration` parameter to distinguish between sign up and sign in
   - Only create user profile if `registration=true`
   - Redirect to registration if user doesn't exist and trying to login
   - Better error handling and user feedback

2. **Updated Login Page** (`app/auth/login/page.tsx`)
   - Pass `registration=false` parameter to OAuth callback
   - Added link to registration page
   - Updated messaging to clarify it's for existing users

3. **Updated Register Page** (`app/auth/register/page.tsx`)
   - Pass `registration=true` parameter to OAuth callback
   - Only creates user profile during registration

4. **Enhanced Middleware** (`lib/supabase/middleware.ts`)
   - Check if authenticated users have a profile before allowing dashboard access
   - Redirect users without profiles to registration
   - Prevent users with profiles from accessing auth pages

5. **Database Migration** (`supabase/migrations/006_remove_auto_user_creation.sql`)
   - Removed automatic user creation trigger
   - Added policy to allow users to insert their own profile during registration

### New Authentication Flow

1. **New User Registration**:
   - User visits `/auth/register`
   - Clicks "Continue with Google"
   - OAuth callback creates user profile
   - Redirected to dashboard

2. **Existing User Login**:
   - User visits `/auth/login`
   - Clicks "Continue with Google"
   - OAuth callback verifies user exists
   - Redirected to dashboard

3. **Unauthorized Access**:
   - User without profile tries to access dashboard
   - Middleware redirects to registration
   - User without profile tries to login
   - Redirected to registration with error message

### Testing Steps

1. **Test New User Registration**:
   - Visit `/auth/register`
   - Sign in with new Google account
   - Should be redirected to dashboard
   - Profile should be created in database

2. **Test Existing User Login**:
   - Visit `/auth/login`
   - Sign in with existing Google account
   - Should be redirected to dashboard
   - No new profile should be created

3. **Test Unauthorized Access**:
   - Try to access `/dashboard` without account
   - Should be redirected to login
   - Try to login with non-existent account
   - Should see error and be prompted to register

4. **Test Middleware Protection**:
   - Authenticated user without profile tries dashboard
   - Should be redirected to registration
   - Authenticated user with profile tries auth pages
   - Should be redirected to dashboard

### Security Improvements

- ✅ Users must explicitly sign up
- ✅ No automatic account creation
- ✅ Proper separation of login/register flows
- ✅ Middleware protection for all routes
- ✅ Clear error messages and user guidance
- ✅ Database-level security with RLS policies
