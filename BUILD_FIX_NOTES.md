# Build Fix Notes

## Date: December 2024

### Issue
The project was not building due to missing dependencies.

### Solution
1. Ran `npm install` to install all project dependencies
2. Verified build with `npm run build` - builds successfully
3. Verified TypeScript with `npm run type-check` - no errors

### Build Status
- ✅ Build completes successfully
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes
- ✅ 67 pages generated
- ⚠️ Minor ESLint warning (non-critical, from Next.js internals)

### Commands Run
```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run type-check
```

The project is now ready for development and deployment.
